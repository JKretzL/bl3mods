Unlock Mayhem-Specific Drops
============================

Borderlands 3 has a number of drops which are locked behind Mayhem levels,
specifically at Mayhem 4 and Mayhem 6.  This mod unlocks those drops, so that
they become possible rewards regardless of your Mayhem level (or even if you're
not using Mayhem Mode at all).

Mayhem 4 Unlocks:

* Anointed X-2: S3RV-80S-EXECUTE
* Arbalest of Discipline: Antifreeze COM
* Aurelia: Juliet's Dazzle
* Billy, the Anointed: Raging Bear COM
* Captain Traunt: Tankman's Shield
* Mr. Titan: Zheitsev's Eruption
* Pain / Agonizer 9000: Crader's EM-P5
* Rampager: Good Juju
* Sylestro: Spiritual Driver COM
* Tink of Cunning: R4kk P4k COM
* Troy Calypso: Vosk's Deathgrip
* Wotan, Valkyrie Squad: (various)

Mayhem 6 Unlocks:

* Anathema, Scourge: (various)
* Captain Traunt: Kaoson
* General Traunt: D.N.A.
* GenIVIV: Reflux
* Katagawa Ball: Multi-tap
* Katagawa Jr.: Sand Hawk
* Killavolt: Monarch
* Pain / Agonizer 9000: Backburner
* Warden: Plaugebearer

**Mod Compatibility Info:**

Better Loot already includes this functionality, so there's no point in using
both of them together (though it shouldn't hurt anything if you *do*).

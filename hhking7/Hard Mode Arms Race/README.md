You complete 10x Boss Race with your eyes closed? Melee down Harker without any issues? Looking for a new challenge?
Then this is the mod for you! No more one-tapping badasses or mowing down mobs with your hands behind your back:
Enemies have a LOT more health and as the Murder Cane shrinks they get even stronger.

DISLAIMER:
This mod is HARD and is aimed to make the game a challenge even with mods like Legendary Arms Race, Loot De-Emphasizer and armsracestarter-orange enabled.
Completing a run with this mod enabled but without any other mods is near impossible: you have been warned.

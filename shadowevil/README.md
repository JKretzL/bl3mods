Borderlands 3 Unofficial Community Patch
========================================

Borderlands 3 Unofficial Community Patch is meant to be a simple and brief overhaul mod pack to improve the game without touching the balance of the weapons & items.

It includes a lot of mods from around the community and it is meant to be a similar experience to a Gearbox patch, except this time, it is from people around the community.
